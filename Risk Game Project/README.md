# Risk

The Risk Game Project folder contains the code from a semester software engineering project that I was project manager for. The project remained incomplete as it was a new addition to the course and the professor agreed that it was beyond the time scope of the course to complete the game. The code contained in the folder contains a compilation of code from myself and other members of the team.

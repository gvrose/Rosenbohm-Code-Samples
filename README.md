# Rosenbohm-Code-Samples

The PDFs contain samples of my code submitted to various classes. I only have the code in PDF form due to the loss of data from a computer when transferring data and reformatting. All samples are from class assignments.

The Risk Project folder contains the code from a semester software engineering project that I was project manager for. The project remained incomplete as it was a new addition to the course and the professor agreed that it was beyond the time scope of the course to complete the game. The code contained in the folder contains a compilation of code from myself and other members of the team.

The Database folder contains samples of database design diagrams and other miscellaneous design elements from a database course.
